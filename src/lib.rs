//! Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.
//! A subset from Rust `std::io` functionality supported for `no-std`.
//!
//! **MSRV:**
//! - stable: `1.81.0`
//! - nightly: `nightly-2022-08-24`
//!
//! NOTE: unstable configuration `--cfg portable_io_unstable_all` in Rust flags is required for Rust nightly
//! pre-`2024-06-09` to enable `error_in_core` feature directive (stabilized in June 2024).
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `alloc` (enabled by default) - mandatory feature - for alloc-related functionality
//! - `os-error` (unstable feature) - support raw OS errors - with some KNOWN PANICS due to MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
//! - `unix-iovec` (unstable feature) - use `iovec` from `libc` for data stored in IoSlice & IoSliceMut
//!
//! ## CFG options
//!
//! - `portable_io_unstable_all` - enable all unstable option(s):
//!   - size hint optimization for Read iterator - uses Rust unstable `min_specialization` feature
//!
//! To enable: use `--cfg portable_io_unstable_all` in Rust flags, set `RUSTFLAGS` env variable
//! when running `cargo build` or `cargo test` for example.
//!
//! <!-- DOC TODO: INCLUDE & ADAPT MORE DOC COMMENTS FROM RUST STD IO LIBRARY CODE -->
//! <!-- DOC TODO: CLEANUP AS MANY CARGO DOC WARNINGS AS POSSIBLE & CHECK THIS IN CI -->
